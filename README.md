# AI Search Algorithms

Implemented BFS, DFS and Simulated Annealing algorithms for a modified version of N-queens problem. In this problem, there can
a block in between 2 queens, think of it as a wall between 2 queens so that they won't clash. 

Input format : 

<algo type> (BFS/DFS/SA)
<board size>
<number of frogs>
<board> (n*n board with 0 as empty location and 2 as a wall)

Example: 
//put this in input.txt
DFS
8
8
00000000
00000000
00000000
00002000
00000000
00000200
00000000
00000000

Output is written to output.txt in the same directory.
